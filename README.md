*********************************
Installation & Use
*********************************
To install, copy all files to folder "C:\Users\(your user name)\Documents\Qlik\Sense\Extensions\TextBubles".

To use, just drag the "Text Bubles" object from the object menu on the left in Edit mode.

Given the nature of the visualization, it uses one dimension and one measure. It uses one buble for every dimension item, and the buble size is proportional to the measure value.
